The Tech Quiz project is centered around building a reliable and robust testing suite for a pre-existing quiz application. The primary goal was to ensure the quiz functions correctly under various scenarios using automated tests. The motivation behind this project was to practice end-to-end (E2E) testing using Cypress and to validate the behavior of the quiz application through comprehensive component testing.
